How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    Finding the bug was possible, because only the lines which differ in the two files are marked.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Every project is "living", as every now and then changes are made on it. Being able to recall
    previous versions saves offers flexibility and saves time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: committing too big or too small changes can be avoided
    cons: proper committing  requests discipline

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google Docs treats files which are not connected within each other, while Git most probably
    handles with files which work together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log lists the commited versions and git diff shows the differences between two selected versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using a control version system allows to come back to a (working) previous solution any time!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    It would be nice to be able to follow the evolution of each coding-project I do.
